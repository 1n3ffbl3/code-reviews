Best Practices for Code Review

1) Review less than 400 lines of code (LOC) at a time - beyond 400 LOC the ability to find defects decrease.

2) Take your time. Inspection rates should under 500 LOC per hour. Even the health and safety says that you need a 10 minut break per hour.

3) Do not review for more than 60 minutes at a time.

4) Set goals and capture metrics.

5) Authors should annotate code before the review occurs because annotations guide the reviewer through the changes, showing which files to look at first and defending the reason behind each code modification.

6) Use checklists.

7) Establish a process for fixing defects found.

8) Foster a positive code review culture. While itÂ´s easy to see defects as purely negative, each bug is actually an opportunity for the team to improve code quality. Peer review also allows junior team members to learn from senior leaders and for even the most experienced programmers to break bad habits.

9) Embrace the subconscious implications of peer review.

10) Practice lightweight code reviews.
